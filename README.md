## Getting Started

- Install dependencies: `npm install`. We will install more dependencies for Webpack and Babel along the way.

- Once you've setup your Webpack config file (`webpack.config.js`) in the challenges below, you can create your Webpack production build by running: `npm run build`. You can then run the application server with `npm start` and view the React application on `localhost:3000`
